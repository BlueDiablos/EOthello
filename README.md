# How To Play

- Othello is a strategy board game for two players (Black and White), played on an 8 by 8 board. The game traditionally begins with four discs placed in the middle of the board. Black moves first.

- Black or white must place a black disc on the board, in such a way that there is at least one straight (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) occupied line between the new disc and another black disc, with one or more contiguous white pieces between them.

- After placing the disc, the player flips all the opposing players discs lying on a straight line between the new disc and any existing black discs. All flipped discs are now the current players discs.

- Players alternate taking turns. If a player does not have any valid moves, the play passes back to the other player. When neither player can move, the game ends. A game of Othello may end before the board is completely filled.

- The player with the most discs on the board wins.
